# What-are-the-benefits-of-wearing-Hessonite-Gomed-stone-for-career-and-financial-growth-

Hessonite, popularly known as Gomed, is linked with the shadow planet Rahu in Vedic astrology. This gemstone is believed to bring stability, career growth, and sudden opportunities for success. People facing obstacles in career, delays in promotions, or struggles in achieving recognition may benefit from Gomed. It helps overcome confusion, fear, and psychological stress, bringing clarity of thought and confidence. In business, Gomed is said to attract prosperity, financial gains, and growth in reputation. It is also helpful for those working in politics, public services, research, or media, as it provides strong influence and persuasive abilities. Hessonite also protects against enemies, hidden competition, and negative influences caused by Rahu dosha. However, since Rahu is a shadow planet, Gomed must only be worn after consulting an expert astrologer. A natural certified Gomed gemstone ensures genuine effects and long-term benefits.
